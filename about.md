### **Core Competencies**

#### **AI/ML and Data Engineering**
* [cite_start]**Generative AI:** Architected and deployed AI-powered data extraction pipelines on **GCP** leveraging **LLMs (OpenAI/Claude)** and **Prompt Engineering** to automate web scraping[cite: 7]. [cite_start]This reduced manual data entry by **10 hours/week**[cite: 7].
* [cite_start]**Computer Vision:** Developed a computer vision model using **Python, PyTorch, and Faster R-CNN** for Visual Grounding [cite: 36][cite_start], achieving **65.7% accuracy** on the RefCOCOg benchmark[cite: 36].
* [cite_start]**Data Streaming:** Streamlined real-time data streaming with **Kafka** and migrated critical data to **Snowflake** [cite: 24, 25][cite_start], enhancing data accessibility and system performance by **20%**[cite: 24].

#### **Full-Stack Development**
* [cite_start]**Front-End:** Built **React-based UIs** for trading workflows supporting **15+ live production interfaces**[cite: 7]. [cite_start]Developed **15+ Angular pages** for financial dashboards, reducing load time from 12 seconds to **2 seconds**[cite: 12].
* [cite_start]**Back-End/Microservices:** Implemented **C#.NET microservices** and **RESTful APIs**[cite: 8]. [cite_start]Engineered a micro-service using **Java Spring Boot** and **PostgreSQL** that reduced monthly report generation from 3 days to **8 hours**[cite: 13].

#### **Cloud & DevOps**
* [cite_start]**Cloud Cost Optimization:** Optimized cloud spending across **AWS** and **Azure** [cite: 19, 20][cite_start], delivering **25% cost reduction** and **\$30K in annualized client savings**[cite: 20].
* [cite_start]**Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Provisioned infrastructure using **Terraform IaC** and **Docker** containerization [cite: 19][cite_start], reducing deployment time from 3 hours to **45 minutes**[cite: 19].
* [cite_start]**CI/CD:** Enhanced code quality through **TDD** practices using **Jasmine** and **Karma**, achieving **83% test coverage**[cite: 14].
